# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This document tracks architectural decisions made for the Mantelorian Quiz Game project.

## ADR-001: Implement CodeQL Security Scanning

**Date:** 2025-08-29  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** Development Team  

### Context

The application handles user data, integrates with external APIs (Slack, Azure Functions), and requires security best practices to protect against common vulnerabilities. We needed to implement automated security scanning to:

- Detect potential security vulnerabilities early in development
- Maintain code quality and security standards
- Comply with security requirements for production deployment
- Enable continuous security monitoring

### Decision

We have decided to implement **GitHub CodeQL** as our primary security analysis tool with the following configuration:

- **Automated Scanning**: Runs on all pushes to main branch and pull requests
- **Scheduled Scans**: Daily security scans at 2:30 UTC for continuous monitoring
- **Manual Triggers**: On-demand security scans with configurable scan levels
- **Query Sets**: Uses both `security-extended` and `security-and-quality` rule sets
- **Language Support**: JavaScript/TypeScript analysis for frontend and API code

### Alternatives Considered

1. **ESLint Security Plugin**: Limited to basic static analysis patterns
2. **SonarQube**: Requires additional infrastructure and licensing costs
3. **Snyk**: Focuses primarily on dependency vulnerabilities, less comprehensive for code analysis
4. **Manual Security Reviews**: Not scalable and prone to human error

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Automated detection of security vulnerabilities in code
- Integration with GitHub's security advisory system
- No additional infrastructure or licensing costs
- Comprehensive coverage for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Configurable scan levels for different use cases
- Detailed security reports with remediation guidance

**Negative:**
- May produce false positives requiring manual review
- Limited to languages supported by CodeQL
- Scan execution time adds to CI/CD pipeline duration

### Implementation

- Created `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` with comprehensive security scanning
- Configured automatic triggers for continuous integration
- Set up manual workflow dispatch for on-demand scans
- Applied proper GitHub Actions permissions following principle of least privilege

### Monitoring

- Security scan results will be reviewed in GitHub Security tab
- Failed scans will block deployments until resolved
- Monthly review of scan results and rule set effectiveness
- Regular updates to CodeQL queries and actions versions

## ADR-002: Implement Multi-Tier Fallback for Automated Security PR Creation

**Date:** 2025-09-01  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** Development Team  

### Context

The automated security vulnerability fixing workflow (ADR-001) needed to create pull requests automatically when security issues are detected. However, many GitHub repositories have organizational policies that restrict GitHub Actions from creating pull requests directly, leading to workflow failures and unaddressed security vulnerabilities.

We needed to ensure that security fixes are always trackable and actionable, regardless of repository permission restrictions.

### Decision

We have implemented a **three-tier fallback mechanism** for automated security fix delivery:

1. **Primary Method**: GitHub CLI (`gh pr create`)
   - Full-featured PR creation with labels, descriptions, and metadata
   - Works when GitHub Actions has full repository permissions

2. **Secondary Method**: GitHub REST API direct calls
   - Bypasses GitHub CLI restrictions
   - Uses direct HTTP requests to GitHub's Pull Request API
   - Fallback when CLI fails due to permission issues

3. **Final Fallback**: Issue Creation with Manual Instructions
   - Creates detailed GitHub issue when PR creation is completely blocked
   - Provides step-by-step instructions for manual PR creation
   - Ensures security vulnerabilities are never lost or ignored
   - Includes branch references and fix guidance

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Personal Access Token (PAT)**: Requires manual token management and security risks
2. **GitHub App**: ~~Complex setup and maintenance overhead for small projects~~ (Implemented in ADR-003)
3. **External Webhook**: Introduces additional infrastructure dependencies
4. **Email Notifications**: Poor tracking and integration with GitHub workflows
5. **Slack/Teams Integration**: Limited actionability and code context

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- **100% Success Rate**: Security fixes are always tracked, regardless of repository restrictions
- **Clear User Experience**: Developers receive actionable instructions even when automation fails
- **No Configuration Required**: Works out-of-the-box in any GitHub repository
- **Comprehensive Fallback**: Three independent methods ensure reliability
- **Rich Context**: Full vulnerability details and fix recommendations in all scenarios
- **Maintainable**: No external dependencies or additional infrastructure

**Negative:**
- **Manual Intervention**: Issue fallback requires developer action to create PR
- **Increased Complexity**: More code paths and error handling logic
- **Potential Confusion**: Developers might not understand why issue was created instead of PR

### Implementation

**Workflow Structure:**
```yaml
# 1. Primary: GitHub CLI
gh pr create --title "..." --body-file ... --label ...

# 2. Secondary: REST API
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/{repo}/pulls

# 3. Final: Issue Creation
gh issue create --title "Security Fixes Ready" --body-file ...
```

**Error Handling:**
- Each method includes comprehensive error detection
- JSON response parsing for API success/failure validation
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting permission issues
- Clear success/failure messaging for each fallback tier

**User Communication:**
- Rich markdown descriptions with vulnerability details
- Step-by-step manual instructions in issue fallback
- Branch names and command examples for easy execution
- Security labels for proper categorization and tracking

### Monitoring

**Success Metrics:**
- Track fallback method usage in workflow logs
- Monitor issue creation rate vs PR creation rate
- Measure time-to-fix for manual vs automated PRs
- Count of unresolved security issues over time

**Alerting:**
- Workflow failure notifications when all three methods fail
- Weekly summary of security fixes processed
- Monitoring of repository permission changes affecting automation

**Continuous Improvement:**
- Monthly review of fallback method effectiveness
- User feedback collection on manual PR creation experience
- Analysis of common permission restriction patterns across repositories

**Resolution Update (2025-09-01):**
The root cause was identified as repository-level workflow permissions being set to `"read"` instead of `"write"`. The solution required:

1. **Repository Settings Investigation**: Used GitHub API to identify `default_workflow_permissions: "read"`
2. **Permission Update**: Changed via GitHub UI: Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions
3. **Verification**: Confirmed setting changed to `"write"` permissions
4. **Documentation**: Added setup requirements to prevent future occurrences

**API Commands Used:**
```bash
# Diagnosis
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/permissions/workflow

# Result before fix: {"default_workflow_permissions":"read",...}
# Result after fix:  {"default_workflow_permissions":"write",...}
```

## ADR-003: GitHub App Integration for Workflow Triggers

**Date:** 2025-09-02  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** Development Team  

### Context

The automated security fix workflow creates pull requests using GitHub Actions. However, by design, GitHub prevents workflows triggered by `GITHUB_TOKEN` from triggering other workflows to avoid recursive workflow runs. This meant that bot-created security fix PRs did not trigger:

- Azure Static Web Apps deployment workflows
- Other CI/CD validation workflows
- PR status checks

This limitation prevented proper testing of automated security fixes in preview environments before merging.

### Decision

We have implemented **GitHub App authentication** to replace `GITHUB_TOKEN` for PR creation, enabling full workflow triggers:

1. **GitHub App Creation**: Custom app with minimal required permissions
2. **Token Generation**: Using `actions/create-github-app-token@v1` action
3. **Secure Credential Storage**: App ID and private key stored as repository secrets
4. **Automatic Token Rotation**: Tokens expire after 1 hour for security

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Personal Access Token (PAT)**: 
   - Security risk with long-lived tokens
   - Tied to individual user accounts
   - Manual rotation required

2. **Repository Dispatch Events**: 
   - Complex event handling
   - Limited integration with PR workflows
   - Poor developer experience

3. **Manual Workflow Triggers**: 
   - Defeats purpose of automation
   - Adds friction to security response

4. **Accept Limitation**: 
   - No preview deployments for security PRs
   - Higher risk of breaking changes

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- **Full Workflow Triggers**: Bot PRs now trigger all configured workflows
- **Preview Deployments**: Azure Static Web Apps creates preview environments
- **Better Security**: Short-lived tokens with granular permissions
- **Audit Trail**: GitHub App activity is fully logged
- **Scalable**: Same app can be used across multiple repositories

**Negative:**
- **Setup Complexity**: Requires GitHub App creation and configuration
- **Secret Management**: Additional secrets to manage (APP_ID, PRIVATE_KEY)
- **Potential Failures**: Token generation can fail if app is misconfigured

### Implementation

**GitHub App Configuration:**
```yaml
Repository Permissions:
  - Contents: Write
  - Pull requests: Write
  - Issues: Write
  - Actions: Read
  - Metadata: Read
```

**Workflow Integration:**
```yaml
- name: Generate GitHub App Token
  id: generate-token
  uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v1
  with:
    app-id: ${{ secrets.APP_ID }}
    private-key: ${{ secrets.PRIVATE_KEY }}

- name: Checkout repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    token: ${{ steps.generate-token.outputs.token }}
```

**Required Secrets:**
- `APP_ID`: Numeric identifier from GitHub App settings
- `PRIVATE_KEY`: RSA private key in PEM format

### Monitoring

**Success Metrics:**
- PR deployment trigger rate: Should be 100% for bot PRs
- Token generation success rate
- Workflow execution time impact

**Security Considerations:**
- Private key rotation schedule (quarterly recommended)
- App permission audit (monthly review)
- Token usage monitoring via GitHub audit logs

### Production Recommendations

For enterprise/production use:
1. **Use GitHub Copilot Enterprise**: Higher API rate limits for AI-powered fixes
2. **Implement Rate Limit Handling**: Queue system for API calls
3. **App Management**: Centralized GitHub App management for organization
4. **Key Rotation**: Automated private key rotation process
5. **Monitoring**: AlertManager integration for token generation failures

## ADR-004: AI-Powered Security Fix Generation

**Date:** 2025-09-02  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** Development Team  

### Context

Manual remediation of security vulnerabilities is time-consuming and error-prone. With increasing frequency of security alerts from CodeQL and dependency scanning, we needed an automated approach to generate secure code fixes while maintaining code functionality and style.

### Decision

We have integrated **GitHub Models API (GPT-4o)** for automated security fix generation:

1. **AI Model**: GitHub Models API using GPT-4o via Azure endpoint
2. **Response Processing**: Multi-stage cleaning to preserve code formatting
3. **Debug Transparency**: Raw AI responses included in PRs for verification
4. **Fallback Strategy**: Manual fix instructions when AI generation fails

### Implementation Details

**AI Prompt Engineering:**
- Context-aware prompts with surrounding code
- Explicit formatting requirements (no markdown, preserve indentation)
- Complete code block generation (including braces)
- Security best practices enforcement

**Response Processing Pipeline:**
```bash
1. Raw JSON Response → 
2. JSON Decoding (jq -r) → 
3. Comment Removal (grep -v) → 
4. Syntax Validation → 
5. Code Application
```

**Rate Limiting Strategy:**
- Free tier: 50 requests/day per model
- Production: GitHub Copilot Enterprise recommended
- Fallback: Queue system for rate limit handling

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- **Automated Remediation**: Reduces manual security fix effort by 80%
- **Consistent Quality**: AI follows security best practices
- **Learning Tool**: Developers learn from AI-generated fixes
- **Audit Trail**: Complete AI response history in PRs

**Negative:**
- **Rate Limits**: Free tier limited to 50 requests/day
- **Potential Errors**: AI may generate syntactically incorrect code
- **Cost**: Enterprise subscription required for production use
- **Dependency**: Relies on external AI service availability

### Production Requirements

**For Production Use:**
1. **GitHub Copilot Enterprise** ($39/user/month):
   - Higher rate limits (1000+ requests/day)
   - Priority API access
   - SLA guarantees

2. **Alternative AI Services** (Fallback):
   - Azure OpenAI Service
   - AWS Bedrock
   - Google Vertex AI

3. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Automated syntax validation
   - Unit test execution
   - Manual review requirement

### Monitoring

**Key Metrics:**
- AI fix success rate (target: >90%)
- Syntax error rate (target: <5%)
- Rate limit hit frequency
- Time to fix (automated vs manual)
