# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This document tracks architectural decisions made for the Mantelorian Quiz Game project.

## ADR-001: Implement CodeQL Security Scanning

**Date:** 2025-08-29  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** Development Team  

### Context

The application handles user data, integrates with external APIs (Slack, Azure Functions), and requires security best practices to protect against common vulnerabilities. We needed to implement automated security scanning to:

- Detect potential security vulnerabilities early in development
- Maintain code quality and security standards
- Comply with security requirements for production deployment
- Enable continuous security monitoring

### Decision

We have decided to implement **GitHub CodeQL** as our primary security analysis tool with the following configuration:

- **Automated Scanning**: Runs on all pushes to main branch and pull requests
- **Scheduled Scans**: Daily security scans at 2:30 UTC for continuous monitoring
- **Manual Triggers**: On-demand security scans with configurable scan levels
- **Query Sets**: Uses both `security-extended` and `security-and-quality` rule sets
- **Language Support**: JavaScript/TypeScript analysis for frontend and API code

### Alternatives Considered

1. **ESLint Security Plugin**: Limited to basic static analysis patterns
2. **SonarQube**: Requires additional infrastructure and licensing costs
3. **Snyk**: Focuses primarily on dependency vulnerabilities, less comprehensive for code analysis
4. **Manual Security Reviews**: Not scalable and prone to human error

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Automated detection of security vulnerabilities in code
- Integration with GitHub's security advisory system
- No additional infrastructure or licensing costs
- Comprehensive coverage for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Configurable scan levels for different use cases
- Detailed security reports with remediation guidance

**Negative:**
- May produce false positives requiring manual review
- Limited to languages supported by CodeQL
- Scan execution time adds to CI/CD pipeline duration

### Implementation

- Created `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` with comprehensive security scanning
- Configured automatic triggers for continuous integration
- Set up manual workflow dispatch for on-demand scans
- Applied proper GitHub Actions permissions following principle of least privilege

### Monitoring

- Security scan results will be reviewed in GitHub Security tab
- Failed scans will block deployments until resolved
- Monthly review of scan results and rule set effectiveness
- Regular updates to CodeQL queries and actions versions
